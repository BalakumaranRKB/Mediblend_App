# Mediblend_App

### Developed a health-based application alongside 3 graduate students to cater to the needs and requirements of patients, healthcare providers, and insurance companies. Created entities and modeled ER relationships using Lucidchart. Implemented the physical data model and data loading using MySQL workbench. Form-based UIs were built using Retool enabling participants to upload data and view live updates. This health-based app allows patients to view diagnosis information, vital signs, total costs for procedures, etc. A wrrite-up report has been provided to indicate the various steps involved in achieving the end product. A copy of the enitre database model has been uploaded for reference to view how the entities were modeled.
